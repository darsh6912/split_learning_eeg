Project Overview

This project focuses on EEG Signal Classification for imagined speech recognition using data acquired from RMS EEG devices. The system processes raw EEG signals, extracts features, and classifies imagined words using machine learning models. The project has applications in Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs), silent communication, cognitive biometrics, and assistive healthcare.
